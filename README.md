# uno
This is a command-line based UNO card game simulator that supports 2-5 players. The game implements all classic UNO rules including special cards (Skip, Reverse, Draw Two, Wild, and Draw Four). Players take turns playing matching cards by color or number, with special cards affecting gameplay through actions like reversing turn order, skipping players, or forcing card draws.
