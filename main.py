# project main
#
# This program will simulate a game of UNO. The program will ask the user if they want to play a game of UNO. If the
# user says yes, the program will ask the user how many players they want to play with. The program will then create a
# deck of cards, deal 5 cards to each player, and deal a card to the discard pile. The program will loop through the
# players and ask each player to play a card. If the player has a playable card, then the program will ask the player
# to choose a card. If the player does not have a card that can be played, the program will draw a card for the player.
# The program will then check if the player has won the game. If the player has won the game, the program will print the
# player's name and end the game. If the player has not won the game, the program will move on to the next player.
